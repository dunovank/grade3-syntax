## grade3-syntax theme for Atom

grade3-syntax is an obvious choice for all those times when you're like... man, I'm feeling pretty nostalgic about 3rd grade right now, but my syntax theme is too punk-rock academy hackerdude supreme.

And when the moment's over, switch back to [oceans16](https://github.com/dunovank/oceans16-syntax) or  [oceans16-bright](https://github.com/dunovank/oceans16-bright-syntax) themes. If you're feeling it, go dress up your IPython (Jupyter) Notebooks [here](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes).
